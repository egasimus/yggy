# Yggy 🌍🌳🌎

Yggy is a bidirectional adapter that establishes a mapping
between an in-memory JavaScript object and the contents of
a directory tree on the filesystem -- because both are,
fundamentally, structured as _trees_.

The main benefit of Yggy is that it lets you view and
manipulate coarse program state without special tooling.
This makes it the ideal datastore when developing scripts,
batch jobs, and one-off microfrontends.
